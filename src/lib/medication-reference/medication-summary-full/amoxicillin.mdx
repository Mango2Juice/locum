## Indications

Amoxicillin is primarily used for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below:

-   **Ear, Nose, and Throat Infections**: Such as otitis media, pharyngitis, and sinusitis.
-   **Genitourinary Tract Infections**: Uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
-   **Skin and Skin Structure Infections**: Caused by streptococci, staphylococci (non-penicillinase-producing), and E. coli.
-   **Lower Respiratory Tract Infections**: Including pneumonia caused by *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, and *Staphylococcus* species.
-   **Helicobacter pylori Eradication**: As part of a multi-drug regimen to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence.

    It is important to culture and identify the causative organisms and determine their susceptibility to amoxicillin.

## Dosing in Paediatrics

Dosing for amoxicillin in children is primarily based on weight and the severity of the infection.

### General Dosing

-   **Standard Dose**: 25-50 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 to 12 hours.
-   **High Dose (for resistant organisms)**: 80-90 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8 to 12 hours.

### Specific Indications

-   **Acute Otitis Media**: For patients with moderate to severe symptoms, high-dose amoxicillin (80-90 mg/kg/day) is recommended.
-   **Community-Acquired Pneumonia**: Dosing varies by age and severity, often starting with high-dose therapy.

    **Renal Impairment**: Dosage adjustment is required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min). Consult specific guidelines for dosing adjustments.

## Adverse Effects

Common adverse effects associated with amoxicillin include:

-   **Gastrointestinal**: Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
-   **Hypersensitivity**: Rash (including a non-allergic amoxicillin rash), urticaria.
-   **Superinfection**: Development of a secondary infection, such as candidiasis.

    <AlertTitle>Anaphylaxis Warning</AlertTitle>
    <AlertDescription>
        Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy. Before initiating therapy with amoxicillin, careful inquiry should be made concerning previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens.
    </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

## Drug Interactions

-   **Probenecid**: Decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin, increasing its blood levels.
-   **Allopurinol**: Concurrent use may increase the incidence of rashes.
-   **Anticoagulants**: May prolong the prothrombin time.
-   **Oral Contraceptives**: May reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives.

## Pregnancy and Lactation

-   **Pregnancy Category B**: Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Use only if clearly needed.
-   **Lactation**: Amoxicillin is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin is administered to a nursing woman.
